## Authentication

This application uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. Users can register and log in via the `/api/v1/auth` endpoints. Upon successful authentication, the server returns a JWT which must be included in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

The endpoints below are marked with their authentication requirements:

- ðŸ”“ Public: No authentication required
- ðŸ”’ Authenticated: Requires a valid JWT
- ðŸ‘‘ Admin: Requires a valid JWT with admin role

## Installation and Setup

1. Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
   - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Locate the [.env-example](.env-example) file in the root directory of the project.
   - Create a new file named `.env` in the same directory.
   - Copy the contents of `.env-example` into `.env`.
   - Fill in the required environment variables in the `.env` file.

4. External service requirements:
   - [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation) account:
     - [Create an unsigned upload preset](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_presets).
     - Obtain your Cloudinary API key from your account dashboard.
   - Gmail account:
     - [Set up an App password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for SMTP email sending.
   - JWT authentication:
     - Generate a Base64-encoded secret key for JWT authentication. You can use an online tool or run this command in your terminal:

       ```bash
       openssl rand -base64 32
       ```

5. Update the `.env` file with the obtained credentials and keys.

6. Generate the JAR file:
   - Navigate to the `backend/vbnb` project directory.
   - Run the following Maven command to generate the JAR file:

     ```bash
     mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true package
     ```

   - The JAR file is going to be generated on `/backend/vbnb/target` with the name `vbnb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
   - Create a `/jar` directory on `/backend/vbnb`
   - Move the generated JAR file to the `/jar` folder.

7. Build and run the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker compose --env-file .env up -d
    ```

## Web Setup

1. Log in as admin with the credentials added to the `.env` file

2. Then we recommend to use the images on [assets](./assets/) or similars to setup the categories, characteristics and listings

   > Note: ensure characteristics and categories are png icons, you can obtain them from [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)

3. Ensure to add the `All` category as it acts as a **filter cleaner**

Note: The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables defined in the `.env` file. Ensure all required variables are properly set before running the containers.
